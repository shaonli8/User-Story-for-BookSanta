Administrator:
● As an administrator, I want users to sign up and login to the website so that they are authenticated users.
● As an administrator, I want to restrict book requests to only one active book request per user so that users’ one request is fulfilled before they can make another request.


User (Someone requesting the book)
● As a user, I want to request for a book of my choice by filling up a form so that I can display information about me and why I want to read a particular book.
● As a user, I want to receive a notification if someone has sent me a book so that I know that my request has been responded to.
● As a user, I want to confirm that I have received a book so that the donor knows that their book has reached the user.
● As a user, I would like to thank the book donor so that they know the gratitude I feel for them.


Donor:
● As a book donor, I want to look at all the active book requests by different people so that I can read details on why someone wants to read that book.
● As a book donor, I want to filter the book requests using a book search field so that I can look at requests for only books which I have.
● As a book donor, I want to look at the address of people making book requests so that I can send the book to them by post.
● As a book donor, I want to have a choice to pay for and send the book through online services like amazon so that I can send someone a book even if I don't have it.
● As a book donor, I want to send an update to a user that I have sent them the book so that the user knows that their request has been fulfilled.
● As a book donor, I want to be notified if the user has received the book I sent so that I know that the book has reached them.
